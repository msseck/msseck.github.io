                    Our users are frustrated because they have trouble determining when 
                    their friends/family are available which makes it difficult to plan
                     outings with them. Our solution should provide users with an accessible 
                     and easy way to view the schedules of their friends/ family.

                    My group and I worked together to brainstorm ways to make shared calendars and event planning
                    helpful while also being rewarding and not a chore.
